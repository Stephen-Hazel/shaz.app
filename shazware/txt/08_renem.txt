rename a bunch of files easily.

I download a lotta files.  And they always have dumb names.

And I'd prefer to use a text editor's search and replace to rename them.

renem makes a big ole file listing for you to just overtype.
Then it renames the ones you overtyped.

 - pick a dir tree

 - renem makes a list of every file and pops your text editor

 - overtype the ones you want to rename, etc, etc.

 - when you're done, SAVE, then click renem to get going.

 - renem pops another big old list of what it's about to do.

 - give it a quick once over and then click renem again to actually do it.

Now, you have a backup of that dir tree, RIGHT ??

Things can go horribly wrong here :)  Be careful.

 - don't delete or add any lines

 - don't change the PATHS, only the filenames - changing paths MIGHT work,
   but i haven't tested it...
