flatpak to shell
I don't know why flatpak doesn't let you easily do CLI.

So I wrote a silly php script to:

 - make a bunch of short bash scripts in current dir

 - of all flatpak commands on your system but without the dumb long suffix.

Or you could just do this manually.  Installin php ain't no fun.
(but i'm just not a python guy)


for example

big

sh@penguin:~/.bin$ cat big
/usr/bin/flatpak run --branch=master --arch=x86_64
--command=big --file-forwarding app.shaz.shazware  $@
