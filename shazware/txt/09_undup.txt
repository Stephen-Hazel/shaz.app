UnDuplicate (kill dup files)
There are a lot of midi files to download.
And none of em have good names.

awesome.mid and mysong.mid are actually the exact same file :(

UnDup will pop up your text editor with a listing of dup files within a dir tree


It tries to pick the file with the best filename and prefixes an

x next to the rest.


If it guesses wrong,

 - give the one picked an x prefix

 - remove the x prefixing the <b>good</b> filenae

save !

then click yes in undup.  Or no to skip the whole thing.

undup will pop a list of what it's going to do.
click yes again and it'll do it.

don't mess up the lines !
