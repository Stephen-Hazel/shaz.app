Flattens all the subdirs
pick a top dir to flatten.

You know when you've got a lot of picture files?
And they're in subdirs like

 - Pic/2005/0928_camping/1010001.jpg

And you'ld like to just send all your 2005 pics to your Mom who's stuck with
the "windows picture and fax viewer" ?

mkdir Pic2
cp -pr Pic/2005 Pic2

then flatten Pic2.  The above file would be renamed to

 - Pic2/2005_0928_camping_1010001.jpg

BE CAREFUL !

You'll want to COPY the dir before you flatten it.
So you've still got your dir'd files.
