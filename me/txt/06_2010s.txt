<img src="img/davin.png">
A grandson will change your life.
All the fun of kids;  NO work.
Carissa turns out to be a pretty solid Mom.  That's the best part.


<h3>2013 - divorce :(</h3>
Time for some more life changes.
Yeah, Kathy turned out to be a jerk.  (no she didn't)
Got bored with herself, cheated on me.  Well, that's my opinion.

Got a new teeny house with a swamp !
Ripped off the (terrible) roof and put on a metal one with a turret.
New open ceiling and ladders to lofts and turret.
Built out my living room even more gloriously than it was
 back in the Amiga days:

Big huge tv and speakers.  Speakers in the turret, too.
Big piano/computer stand in the middle of the living room.
New digital drum kit in the living room, too.

You get the idea...

Experienced online dating
yeah, it's terrible.  But pretty eye opening.
 Forces you to realize what it is you need.
 And how much nicer offline dating is.

Girlfriend
So, well, yeah, that's a nice plus.
 I'm stickin' with Annie.

Connor finally gets a job at FedEx.  And money.  His own.  Yeah.


> You are here.

(oh no you're not - i better fill this in sigh)

Ok, so what's the moral we take away from all this?
Phhh.  Who knows.

I dunno.  You could say I sorta kinda like computers I spose.
It was nice growing up in parallel with PCs.

Being old is pleasant.  My kids ain't kids.  PianoCheetah is my baby now.
Well, that and actually playing piano.  I finally no longer suck at piano.

If you're really lookin for a takeaway, here are some nice catchphrases:

- don't be evil

- follow your passions and hope for the best

- it figures

- it is what it is
