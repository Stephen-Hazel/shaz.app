I will NEEEVER install LINUX !!
Do you like windows update?  That alone is why I use Linux.

<b>Oh and if you already got linux installed hit the menu
<==over there</b>

<h3>Can you do it?</h3>
I keep windows because of work.  Or maybe if you game.
If you wanna keep windows, you'll need to know
 - how to use a screwdriver

 - how to connect a little plastic connector

Then get a usb stick and - boom - you totally got this.


We're installing kubuntu cuz it's the best distro.
Other ones install exactly the same.

Also get a <a pop href="raspi.html">raspberry pi</a> !


<h3>Keeping windows safe</h3>
Windows and Linux should never -EVER- live on the same hard drive.

It's possible but just don't.  The problems:
 - partitioning the hard drive - dangerous.

 - grub boot loader - DUMB - Your BIOS can already do this.


They =should= live on the same PC, though.
So it will need 2 drive connectors (we'll find out if it does soon).

Windows and Linux must never know about each other!
When you install linux on a windows PC,
you need to physically disconnect the windows drive.
Otherwise the linux installer will give you options you do NOT want.

Here's where your screwdriver and plastic connector skills come in.


<h3>Don't kill your files</h3>
We're going to install an operating system on a harddrive.
Get your files OFF it.

They're best kept on a USB drive that both operating systems will share.
(So reformat that USB drive as exFAT - not NTFS)

Or getta NAS (network attached storage) for perfection.


<h3>Let's go!</h3>
Prep is gonna be googling the model on your pc's serial# sticker to find out:
 - what key to hold down on boot to get to the bios menu

 - for windows, see if your pc has 2 drive connectors built in

Setup usb stick:
 - download the kubuntu <a pop href="https://kubuntu.org/getkubuntu"
   >.iso file</a>.

 - install and run <a pop href="https://etcher.balena.io">balenaEtcher</a>
   to get that onto your usb stick.  (Remember what your usb stick's name is)


<h3>Install!</h3>
take out the windows drive to keep it (and linux) safe.
 - unscrew the case and find the hard drive

 - it will either be an M2 connector - unscrew and lift out.

 - or a SATA connector - disconnect the plastic connector.

 - connect the new drive for linux and reassemble the case.


<h3>Plug in the usb stick and reboot</h3>
 - and make sure to hold down that key to get you into the bios menu.
   (it's usually F2, F1, Esc or Del)

 - look through this crazy menu for how to change the drive boot order.

 - order your usb stick to the top

 - save then exit and you should see the kubuntu installer kick in.


<h3>Hitting next a lot</h3>
You're not in the installer yet.  You're in the "live" mode which is dumb.
There's some icon to double click to get to the installer.

The installer questions are pretty easy - yes - the whole disk - all of it.
You want "3rd party drivers".  That's the whole point of ubuntu.
give it the wifi password and all the usual stuff.
name your computer some kind of penguin.  Or the installer will fail.  :)

In the end, it'll tell you it needs to reboot.
Click ok.  Then it'll say "Take out the dang usb stick, PAL!".

Dooone !!  See?  I told you !  You got this !


<h3>Windows again</h3>
Now put the windows drive back in.
 Hold down that bios key on boot to pick whether you boot to windows or to
 kubuntu.
 Scoot the drive you want to the top and DISABLE the other drive(s).
Pick the other one as the top to change back and forth.
 But you'll always reboot to the RIGHT one.


<h3>Tweaking :/</h3>
just like windows, linux needs tweaking.  Here's what I do for
 - <a pop href='kubuntu.html'>kubuntu</a>

 - <a pop href='raspi.html'>raspi</a>
