my thoughts on coding on linux
First off, please don't just stick with command line coding.
If there's one thing linux needs it's GUI apps that don't suck.

Before you code, you need to:

 - decide between Qt and GTK.  (Qt sucks way less!)

 - Now you can setup your dev environment.  
   qtcreator is pretty good if you only need the app to run on your own pc.
   <a href='kubuntu.html'>Here's how i install it</a>

 - But if you'll distribute your app, you need to learn flatpak.
   You may be able to get by with <a href="deb.html">.deb files</a>.
   But I wouldn't recommend it.

<h3>Why?</h3>
This may surprise you, but on linux the usual way you install an app is...
 - install a replacement OS on top of your distro.

 - link your app to run on this os instead of the distro os.

 - bundle it all up and distribute.

Why?  Because you can't take an executable on one distro and run it on another.
 Unless the linux you compiled on and the one you hope to run on are very very similar.

Why?  Typically, distros pick a big network of .so files (runtime libraries - called .dll on windows).
 Once they're picked, eeeverything the distro plans to run is compiled using those exact .so versions.

WHY???  I DON'T KNOW!!!  Seems pretty duuuuuumb to me !
 If all the distros decided on a standard set of .sos, everything would be fine.


Ok.  Let's figure out flatpak.  It'll be ok...
