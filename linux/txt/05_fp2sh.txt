flatpak on the command line
This baby looks up the desktop files of flatpak and
 makes some shell scripts in the current dir (be careful!).

Again, excuse my php :)  I just prefer it to python (sorry).

Run this thing in your home dir's bin and it'll make a shell
 script for every installed flatpak with the <b>short</b>
 command name.

So you can just go:

 - chrome

 - pianocheetah

 - ...you get the idea :/
